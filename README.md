Here is the list of changes.

Application’s launch.
All API requests were rewritten by NewtonsoftJson, so you have to extract NewtonsoftJson.dll to the folder with “MinerControl.exe” to calculate the prices correctly.
Following files are necessary for correct start of the application: MinerControl.exe, NewtonsoftJson.dll, Minercontrol.cfg.
Miners can be kept either in the same folder in subfolders, or separately in any place you like. In the second case path should be entered in “minerfolderpath” key (description is below).

Interface Section
1.   Added column “Pending”. Shows amount of pending coins.
2.   Added column “Balance BTC”. If pool’s API reports exchange rate, “Balance” values will be exchanged.
3.   Added “MU” column for measuring hashrate scales. As soon as different pools have different scales for common algos,  all hashrates in configs were normalized to “kH/s”.
4.   Added “CoinName” column. For particular coin mining.
5.   Added “AcSpWrk” column. Shows speed for the worker in config. If you have more than one rig, you can monitor every single part in common result. And "TopAvgSp" column for calculation average Worker speed. 
6.   Added “Config file” button. Now it is possible to switch configs “on-the-fly” from the library.  Application starts with MinerConfig.cfg by default as previously. It should still be in the launch directory.
7.   Added "IdleMining" checkbox. Enables automode, when "minidleseconds" value from config passed after user last input action.

"General" Section
1. All previous keys and options in this segment are working as they were.
2. Added key "minerfolderpath", because most of miners use "usewindow" option, that requires absolute path to be launched correctly. 
It can have 3 options:
- Full absolute path to folder with miners, for example "C:\\Miners\\Nvidia";
- Value "MinerControl". Than it gets full path to directory which contains "MinerControl.exe";
- Be empty, as in previous versions. In this case path remains relative.
The structure for launch path is: MinerFolderPath \APARAM1 \ APARAM2

3.Added WTM Buffer. Radically reduces amount of API requests and accelerates refresh speed.
 It reads the prices from WhatToMine with adjustable frequency. New keys in "general" block:

        "wtmsyncperiod": 3,       time in minutes to refresh WTM prices, by default 3 minutes
        "wtmbuffer": true,        enables or disables WTM Buffer. By default enabled.
        "wtmextracoins":true,     enables prices for coins not included in basic list of WTM. By default enabled. If disabled, prices for coins with "PriceID" in algo section will not be accuired.

4. Donations. Values can be managed by «donationpercentage" and «donationfrequency" keys  in config files. By default it is 0.5% and 60 mins  (18 seconds of mining per hour). You can either decrease, or increase values, if you like this version. It will help for further development and bugs fixing.

5. added key "minidleseconds" for managing idlemining start delay.
6.  added key "hidecolumngr1" for "general" section, hides "Price", "PowerCost", "Fees" columns, 
          and "hidecolumngr2" for "general" section, hides "RejectSpeed", "TopAvgSp", "AcSpWrk", "MU", "PoolFee" columns.

"Algorithms" section
1.  All previous keys and options in this segment are working as they were.
2.  Added “MU” field for measuring scales. As soon as different pools have different scales for common algos,  all hashrates in configs were normalized to “kH/s”.
3.  Added “DevFee” option for cases, when you use miners with devfees. They affect the values in column “Fees”.


 “Services” ("Pools") section 
Services LTCRabbitService, WePayBTC, Manual Service were not changed at all.
Common updates in this segment:
1.   Added “fee” option. Represents the pool fee value.
2.   Added “cweight” option. It is a custom multiplier,  that locally affects the price. For example, when price scale is incorrect, it can be corrected with “cweight” multiplier. 
3.   For some pools added “tag” and “cname” (coin name) keys. They are necessary for catching API’s data correctly, don’t change them.  If you want to add new strings to config for such pools, “tag” and “cname” should 1:1 comply with the spelling, returned by API.
4.   For pools with direct mining to wallets common account name "multi" is used. Particular coin wallets should be mentioned with "wallet" key in coin definition section.
5.   Added "priceid" key. Gets the profitability from WhaToMine foк definite coin. Should be equal to CoinId from WTM.
6.   Added "active" key. If false, the line in config will be skipped.
7.  For pools with self-defined profitabillity added possibility to switch to WTM-based. New key in "pool" section ("pricewtm": true) by default is false.
8.  Additional key in "pools" section "avgspeedticks":10  - number of ticks for averaging worker speed value. 1 tick happens in 1 minute. Values can be from 1 to 60, if 0 then disabled. By default 10 ticks.
9. Additional key "poolenabled" for "pool" section. Enables/disables complete pool.
