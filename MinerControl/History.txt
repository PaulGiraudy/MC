beta9+6

Some bug fixing.

beta9+5

- Claymore Dual 9.3
- ccminer for Bitcore,
- updated config for YIIMP, Zpool
- added pool luckpool.org for tests,
- added pool.coin-miners.info
- test feature for yiimp like pools (coin-miners also) in multicoin algos. As soon as pool's API doesn't provide profitability for each coin 
only for whole algo, MC detects the hashrate for each coin on pool, and coin with higher hashrate acquires higher priority in MC, so called "croud effect".

beta9+4

- added key "hidecolumngr1" for "general" section, hides "Price", "PowerCost", "Fees" columns, 
- added key "hidecolumngr2" for "general" section, hides "RejectSpeed", "TopAvgSp", "AcSpWrk", "MU", "PoolFee" columns,
- added context tooltips for headers,
- added key "poolenabled" for "pool" section. Enables/disables complete pool.

-price dynamics for exchange rate = current exrate/exrate 24h and profitability = current profitability/profitability 24h
-"usewindow" can be set globally now in "general" section
-layout delay for 30sec after manual grid sorting


beta8.3

pumps and dumps detection, daily price fluctuation more than 5%
